# semchange
Code used for quantitative research in linguistics and psycholinguistics, originally written as part of my Master's thesis "The effect of historical events on word meaning change".

`frequent_word_counter.py` is used to extract the most frequent words from a Wikipedia article.

`extract_data_for_main_analysis.py` and `extract_data_for_secondary_analysis.py` are used to extract semantic shift data of words from a list (see events and words for * analysis.txt for formatting examples)

More detailed information about the rationale behind this code and how it was used are available in my Master's thesis, which this code is a companion of.

Should you wish to use this code in your own research, a convenient citation file is available for download at the right hand side of this page.
